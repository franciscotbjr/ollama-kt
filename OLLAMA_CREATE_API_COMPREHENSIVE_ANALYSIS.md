## Overview

The Ollama Create API represents a paradigm shift from traditional AI model training to **configuration-based model specialization**. Instead of training models from scratch, it enables the creation of specialized AI models through inheritance, configuration, and behavioral modification.

### Core Philosophy
> **"Configuration over Training"** - Create specialized models by configuring existing ones rather than training new ones from scratch.

### HTTP Endpoint
```
POST /api/create
```

## API Principles

### 1. **Model Derivation & Inheritance**
Models are created by **deriving from existing models** rather than training from scratch.

```kotlin
CreateRequest(
    model = "my-specialized-assistant",    // New model name
    from = "qwen3:0.6b",                  // Base model to inherit from
    system = "Custom behavior definition"  // Specialization logic
)
```

**Core Concept**: Models inherit the neural weights and capabilities of their parent model while adding specialized behavior through system prompts.

### 2. **Declarative Configuration**
Model behavior is defined through **declarative configuration** rather than imperative programming.

```kotlin
// Declarative approach - what the model should be
system = "You are a helpful assistant that always responds in Portuguese."

// vs Imperative approach - how the model should behave (not supported)
// if (userLanguage == "pt") respond_in_portuguese()
```

### 3. **Composability & Reusability**
Created models become **first-class citizens** that can:
- Serve as base models for further derivations
- Be used in all standard operations (chat, generate, etc.)
- Be shared and distributed like any other model

### 4. **Resource Efficiency**
The API doesn't duplicate model weights unnecessarily:
- **Inherits** base model neural weights
- **Adds** configuration layers on top
- **Optimizes** storage through model sharing mechanisms

### 5. **Lazy Loading & Async Operations**
- Model creation is **asynchronous** and non-blocking
- Supports **streaming** for progress feedback
- Implements **resource-aware** operations

## Request Structure

### ollama-kt Implementation
```kotlin
/**
 * Request to create a new model.
 */
@Serializable
data class CreateRequest(
    val model: String,              // Required: New model name
    val from: String? = null,       // Optional: Base model to inherit from
    val modelfile: String? = null,  // Optional: Complete Modelfile content
    val system: String? = null,     // Optional: System prompt for behavior
    val adapter: String? = null,    // Optional: Model adapter for fine-tuning
    val stream: Boolean = false     // Optional: Stream creation progress
)
```

### Parameter Analysis

#### **Core Parameters**
- **`model`** *(Required)*: Name for the new model
  - Format: `namespace/model-name:tag`
  - Examples: `"my-assistant"`, `"company/code-reviewer:v1"`
  - Becomes the identifier for the created model

- **`from`** *(Optional but Common)*: Base model to inherit from
  - Must be a locally available model
  - Examples: `"qwen3:0.6b"`, `"llama3.1:8b"`, `"codellama:13b"`
  - Provides the foundational neural weights and capabilities

#### **Behavior Modification Parameters**
- **`system`** *(Optional)*: System prompt defining behavior
  - Can be simple: `"You are a helpful assistant"`
  - Can be complex: Multi-paragraph professional specifications
  - Defines personality, expertise, output format, and constraints

- **`adapter`** *(Optional)*: Fine-tuning adapter
  - For more sophisticated model modifications
  - Supports LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and similar techniques
  - Advanced use case for specialized domains

#### **Advanced Configuration**
- **`modelfile`** *(Optional)*: Complete Modelfile specification
  - Alternative to `from` + `system` approach
  - Supports complex multi-step model definitions
  - Allows parameter tuning, template customization, etc.

#### **Operational Parameters**
- **`stream`** *(Optional)*: Enable progress streaming
  - `false`: Return complete response when finished
  - `true`: Stream incremental progress updates
  - Useful for long model creation operations

### Creation Methods

#### Method 1: Simple Inheritance
```kotlin
CreateRequest(
    model = "portuguese-assistant",
    from = "qwen3:0.6b",
    system = "You are a helpful assistant that always responds in Portuguese."
)
```

#### Method 2: Modelfile-Based
```kotlin
CreateRequest(
    model = "advanced-coder",
    modelfile = """
        FROM codellama:13b
        PARAMETER temperature 0.2
        PARAMETER top_k 40
        SYSTEM You are an expert software engineer specializing in clean code and best practices.
        TEMPLATE \"\"\"
        {{ if .System }}<|system|>
        {{ .System }}<|end|>
        {{ end }}{{ if .Prompt }}<|user|>
        {{ .Prompt }}<|end|>
        <|assistant|>
        {{ end }}
        \"\"\"
    """.trimIndent()
)
```

#### Method 3: Adapter-Based Fine-tuning
```kotlin
CreateRequest(
    model = "domain-specific-model",
    from = "llama3.1:8b",
    adapter = "medical-terminology-adapter",
    system = "You are a medical research assistant with expertise in clinical trials."
)
```

## Response Structure

### ollama-kt Implementation
```kotlin
/**
 * Response for create model operations.
 */
@Serializable
data class CreateResponse(
    val status: String  // "success", "error", or progress indicator
)
```

### Response Status Values
- **`"success"`**: Model created successfully
- **`"error"`**: Creation failed with error details
- **Progress indicators**: When streaming is enabled

### Extended Response Information
While the basic response only includes status, the operation provides additional information through:
- **Model verification**: Check if model appears in `list()` operation
- **Error details**: Available in exception messages for failed operations
- **Streaming updates**: Progress information when `stream = true`

## Implementation in ollama-kt

### Client Method
```kotlin
/**
 * Create a new model.
 */
suspend fun create(request: CreateRequest): CreateResponse {
    return executeRequest("create", request.copy(stream = false))
}
```

### Key Implementation Features

#### 1. **Non-Streaming by Default**
```kotlin
request.copy(stream = false)
```
- Simplifies API usage for most cases
- Returns complete response when operation finishes
- Can be overridden for long-running operations

#### 2. **Coroutine-Based Asynchronous Operations**
```kotlin
suspend fun create(request: CreateRequest): CreateResponse
```
- Fully non-blocking using Kotlin coroutines
- Integrates with async/await patterns
- Supports cancellation and timeout handling

#### 3. **HTTP Integration**
```kotlin
executeRequest("create", request)
```
- Maps to `POST /api/create` endpoint
- Handles HTTP errors and status codes
- Provides proper error mapping to `OllamaException`

#### 4. **Type Safety**
- Strongly-typed request and response models
- Compile-time validation of parameters
- Serialization handled automatically

    }
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. **Model Naming Conventions**
```kotlin
// Good naming practices
"company-code-reviewer"     // Clear purpose
"medical-research-v2"       // Versioning
"customer-support-en"       // Language specification
"data-analyst-finance"      // Domain specification

// Avoid
"model1"                    // Non-descriptive
"temp-test-model"          // Temporary naming
"my-assistant-final-v3"    // Verbose versioning
```

### 2. **System Prompt Design**
```kotlin
// Structured approach
val systemPrompt = """
    IDENTITY: [Who the model should be]
    EXPERTISE: [What domains to focus on]  
    METHODOLOGY: [How to approach problems]
    OUTPUT FORMAT: [How to structure responses]
    CONSTRAINTS: [What to avoid or limitations]
""".trimIndent()

// Include examples for complex behaviors
val withExamples = """
    You are a JSON API designer. Always respond with valid JSON.
    
    Example input: "Create user endpoint"
    Example output:
    {
        "endpoint": "POST /api/users",
        "request": {"name": "string", "email": "string"},
        "response": {"id": "uuid", "name": "string", "email": "string"}
    }
""".trimIndent()
```

### 3. **Base Model Selection**
```kotlin
// Choose appropriate base models
val codeModel = CreateRequest(
    model = "code-reviewer",
    from = "codellama:13b",        // Code-focused base model
    system = "Review code for bugs and improvements"
)

val chatModel = CreateRequest(
    model = "customer-support", 
    from = "llama3.1:8b",          // General conversation model
    system = "Provide friendly customer support"
)

val analysisModel = CreateRequest(
    model = "data-analyst",
    from = "mixtral:8x7b",         // Reasoning-focused model
    system = "Analyze data and provide insights"
)
```

### 4. **Model Verification**
```kotlin
suspend fun createAndVerify(request: CreateRequest): Boolean {
    val client = OllamaClient()
    
    try {
        // Create model
        val response = client.create(request)
        if (response.status != "success") return false
        
        // Verify existence
        val models = client.list()
        val exists = models.models.any { it.name.contains(request.model) }
        if (!exists) return false
        
        // Test functionality
        val testResponse = client.generate(GenerateRequest(
            model = request.model,
            prompt = "Hello, introduce yourself briefly."
        ))
        
        return testResponse.response.isNotEmpty()
        
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        println("Verification failed: ${e.message}")
        return false
    } finally {
        client.close()
    }
}
```

### 5. **Resource Management**
```kotlin
suspend fun createWithResourceManagement() {
    val client = OllamaClient()
    
    try {
        // Use smaller models for testing
        val testRequest = CreateRequest(
            model = "test-assistant",
            from = "qwen3:0.6b",  // 498MB - faster for development
            system = "You are a test assistant."
        )
        
        // Production model with larger capacity
        val prodRequest = CreateRequest(
            model = "prod-assistant",
            from = "llama3.1:8b",  // Better capabilities
            system = "You are a production assistant."
        )
        
        // Create based on environment
        val request = if (isTestEnvironment()) testRequest else prodRequest
        val response = client.create(request)
        
        println("Created: ${response.status}")
        
    } finally {
        client.close()
    }
}
```

## Advanced Use Cases

### 1. **Multi-Model Workflow Systems**
```kotlin
class SpecializedWorkflow {
    suspend fun processDocument(document: String): ProcessedDocument {
        val client = OllamaClient()
        
        try {
            // Step 1: Content analysis
            val analysis = client.generate(GenerateRequest(
                model = "document-analyzer",
                prompt = "Analyze this document structure: $document"
            ))
            
            // Step 2: Technical review
            val review = client.generate(GenerateRequest(
                model = "technical-reviewer", 
                prompt = "Review technical accuracy: $document"
            ))
            
            // Step 3: Language improvement
            val improved = client.generate(GenerateRequest(
                model = "editor-assistant",
                prompt = "Improve clarity and readability: $document"
            ))
            
            return ProcessedDocument(
                original = document,
                analysis = analysis.response,
                review = review.response,
                improved = improved.response
            )
            
        } finally {
            client.close()
        }
    }
}
```

```

### 3. **Multilingual Model Creation**
```kotlin
suspend fun createMultilingualSupport() {
    val client = OllamaClient()
    
    val languages = mapOf(
        "pt" to "Portuguese",
        "es" to "Spanish", 
        "fr" to "French",
        "de" to "German"
    )
    
    try {
        languages.forEach { (code, language) ->
            client.create(CreateRequest(
                model = "support-assistant-$code",
                from = "llama3.1:8b",
                system = """
                    You are a customer support assistant that communicates exclusively in $language.
                    Provide helpful, friendly, and professional customer service.
                    Adapt your responses to local cultural context and business practices.
                    
                    Key principles:

                """.trimIndent()
            ))
        }
        
        println("Created multilingual support models")
        
    } finally {
        client.close()
    }
}
```

### 4. **A/B Testing Model Variants**
```kotlin
class ModelVariantTesting {
    suspend fun createVariants() {
        val client = OllamaClient()
        
        // Variant A: Formal communication
        val formalAssistant = CreateRequest(
            model = "assistant-formal-v1",

            """.trimIndent()
        )
        
        try {
            client.create(formalAssistant)

        } finally {
            client.close()
        }
    }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios

#### 1. **Base Model Not Found**
```kotlin
try {
    val response = client.create(CreateRequest(
        model = "my-assistant",
        from = "nonexistent-model:latest",  // Model doesn't exist
        system = "You are helpful"
    ))
} catch (e: OllamaException.HttpException) {
    when (e.statusCode) {
        404 -> println("Base model not found. Check available models with client.list()")
        else -> println("HTTP error: ${e.message}")
    }
}
```

#### 2. **Invalid Model Names**
```kotlin
// Invalid characters in model name
try {
    client.create(CreateRequest(
        model = "my@invalid#model",  // Special characters not allowed
        from = "qwen3:0.6b",
        system = "Test"
    ))
} catch (e: OllamaException.HttpException) {
    println("Invalid model name format: ${e.message}")
}
```

#### 3. **Resource Exhaustion**
```kotlin
try {
    client.create(CreateRequest(
        model = "large-model",
        from = "llama3.1:70b",  // Very large model
        system = "Complex system prompt"
    ))
} catch (e: OllamaException.NetworkException) {
    if (e.message?.contains("timeout") == true) {
        println("Model creation timed out. Try using a smaller base model.")
    } else {
        println("Network error during creation: ${e.message}")
    }
}
```

#### 4. **Comprehensive Error Handling**
```kotlin
suspend fun createModelSafely(request: CreateRequest): Result<String> {
    val client = OllamaClient()
    
    return try {
        // Verify base model exists
        if (request.from != null) {
            val availableModels = client.list()
            val baseModelExists = availableModels.models.any { 
                it.name == request.from 
            }
            if (!baseModelExists) {
                return Result.failure(Exception("Base model '${request.from}' not found"))
            }
        }
        
        // Create model
        val response = client.create(request)
        
        if (response.status == "success") {
            // Verify creation
            val models = client.list()
            val created = models.models.any { it.name.contains(request.model) }
            
            if (created) {
                Result.success("Model '${request.model}' created successfully")
            } else {
                Result.failure(Exception("Model creation reported success but model not found"))
            }
        } else {
            Result.failure(Exception("Model creation failed: ${response.status}"))
        }
        
    } catch (e: OllamaException.HttpException) {
        Result.failure(Exception("HTTP error (${e.statusCode}): ${e.message}"))
    } catch (e: OllamaException.NetworkException) {
        Result.failure(Exception("Network error: ${e.message}"))
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        Result.failure(Exception("Unexpected error: ${e.message}"))
    } finally {
        client.close()
    }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### 1. **Model Size Impact**
```kotlin
// Performance comparison of base models
val performanceGuide = mapOf(
    "qwen3:0.6b" to "Fast creation (~30s), lower capabilities",
    "llama3.1:8b" to "Moderate creation (~2-3min), good balance", 
    "mixtral:8x7b" to "Slower creation (~5-10min), high capabilities",
    "codellama:34b" to "Very slow creation (~15-30min), specialized code"
)

// Choose based on requirements
suspend fun createOptimizedModel(useCase: String) {
    val baseModel = when (useCase) {
        "development" -> "qwen3:0.6b"      // Fast iteration
        "production" -> "llama3.1:8b"      // Good balance
        "specialized" -> "mixtral:8x7b"    // High capability
        else -> "qwen3:0.6b"
    }
    
    // ... create model with selected base
}
```

### 2. **System Prompt Optimization**
```kotlin
// Efficient system prompt design
val efficientPrompt = """
    ROLE: Code reviewer
    FOCUS: Security, performance, maintainability
    OUTPUT: Brief analysis with specific recommendations
""".trimIndent()

// Avoid overly complex prompts that consume context
val overlyComplex = """
    You are a senior software engineer with exactly 15.5 years of experience...
    [3000+ words of detailed specifications]
""".trimIndent()  // May impact performance
```

### 3. **Resource Management**
```kotlin
class ModelManager {
    private val createdModels = mutableSetOf<String>()
    
    suspend fun createModel(request: CreateRequest): CreateResponse {
        val client = OllamaClient()
        
        try {
            val response = client.create(request)
            if (response.status == "success") {
                createdModels.add(request.model)
            }
            return response
        } finally {
            client.close()
        }
    }
    
    suspend fun cleanup() {
        val client = OllamaClient()
        
        try {
            createdModels.forEach { modelName ->
                try {
                    client.delete(DeleteRequest(model = modelName))
                    println("Cleaned up model: $modelName")
                } catch (e: Exception) {
                    println("Failed to cleanup $modelName: ${e.message}")
                }
            }
            createdModels.clear()
        } finally {
            client.close()
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. **Concurrent Model Creation**
```kotlin
suspend fun createMultipleModels(requests: List<CreateRequest>) = coroutineScope {
    val client = OllamaClient()
    
    try {
        val results = requests.map { request ->
            async {
                try {
                    val response = client.create(request)
                    request.model to response.status
                } catch (e: Exception) {
                    request.model to "error: ${e.message}"
                }
            }
        }
        
        results.awaitAll().forEach { (model, status) ->
            println("$model: $status")
        }
    } finally {
        client.close()
    }
}
```
