## Usage Examples in ollama-kt

```kotlin
class ComplexSystemPrompts {
    suspend fun createSpecializedModels() {
        val client = OllamaClient()
        
        try {
            // Create code reviewer
            val codeReviewer = client.create(codeReviewExpert)
            println("Created: ${codeReviewer.status}")
            
            // Create technical writer
            val techWriter = client.create(technicalWriter)
            println("Created: ${techWriter.status}")
            
            // Create financial analyst
            val analyst = client.create(financialAnalyst)
            println("Created: ${analyst.status}")
            
            // Test the specialized models
            testSpecializedModel(client, "senior-code-reviewer", "Review this Kotlin function...")
            testSpecializedModel(client, "technical-documentation-expert", "Document this API...")
            testSpecializedModel(client, "senior-financial-analyst", "Analyze Apple's Q3 earnings...")
            
        } finally {
            client.close()
        }
    }
    
    private suspend fun testSpecializedModel(
        client: OllamaClient, 
        model: String, 
        prompt: String
    ) {
        val response = client.generate(GenerateRequest(
            model = model,
            prompt = prompt
        ))
        println("Response from $model: ${response.response}")
    }
}
